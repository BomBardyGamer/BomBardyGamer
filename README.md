### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ hello! Good to see you!

My name's Callum, and I'm a 16 year old somewhat self-taught Kotlin/Java developer! I don't have that many personal projects because I spend most of my time making contributions to other open-source projects, as can be seen by my GitHub stats, but I do make a few personal projects, and I've listed them below.

<p>
  <h2 align="center">Here's some stuff I've been working on relatively recently:</h2>
</p>

<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>BardyBot</b> - BardyBot is a music bot that acts and responds like a human, but he's written in Spring, so he's super fast and reliable. He's also free and open-source, and self-hosting him is quite easy and intuitive, so he's a good alternative to other music bots such as Rythm, which often lag behind under the load of delivering music to many servers, but self-hosting makes him dedicated and personal to you.</li>
  <li><b>Punishments</b> - Punishments is a work in progress cross-platform bans plugin that I plan on being a good alternative to LiteBans and other proprietary software that don't have the benefit of being open-source, and so aren't as adaptable and developers and end users don't have as much freedom, meaning some larger servers that need extra features often have to write their own system.</li>
  <li><b>Adapters</b> - Adapters is a library for working with NMS. It's based around the idea of NMS adapters, where you can adapt the code you're running to the version the server is running. I decided to try and make a library out of that, and I'm still working on it. It's quite a large project, but I hope I can finish it in the near future.</li>
</ul>

More projects may be coming soon, so keep your eyes peeled.
