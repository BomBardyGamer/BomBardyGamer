### Hey there! I see you've come to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Callum, and I'm a 19 year old somewhat self-taught Java developer! I don't have that many personal projects
because I spend most of my time making contributions to other open-source projects, as can be seen by my GitHub stats, but
I do make a few personal projects every now and again.

Most of my time these days is spent working on
<a href="https://github.com/EmortalMC">EmortalMC</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hollow-cube">Hollow Cube</a>.

#### Contact

If you need to reach out to me, I recommend doing so using Discord. My Discord username is `bombardygamer`.

You can also email me if you want it to be a bit more formal. My email address is `callum.seabrook@prevarinite.com`.
