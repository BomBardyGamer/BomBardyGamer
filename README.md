### Hey there! I see you've come to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Callum, and I'm a 16 year old somewhat self-taught Kotlin/Java developer! I don't have that many personal projects because I spend most of my time making contributions to other open-source projects, as can be seen by my GitHub stats, but I do make a few personal projects, and I've listed them below.

<p>
  <h2 align="center">Here's some stuff I've been working on relatively recently:</h2>
</p>

<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Krypton</b> - Krypton is a lightweight Minecraft server implementation written in Kotlin. It's currently in very early alpha, but it seems to perform relatively well, and it does some things.</li>
  <li><b>BardyBot</b> - BardyBot is a music bot that acts and responds like a human. It's written in Spring, so it's (supposedly) fast and reliable. It's also free and open-source, and self-hosting it is quite trivial, so he's a good alternative to other music bots such as Rythm, which often lag behind under the load of delivering music to many servers.</li>
  <li><b>Punishments</b> - Punishments is a work in progress cross-platform bans plugin that I plan on being a good alternative to LiteBans and other proprietary software that don't have the benefit of being open-source, and so aren't as adaptable, and developers and end users don't have as much freedom, meaning some larger servers that need extra features often have to write their own system.</li>
  <li><b>Adapters</b> - Adapters is a library for working with NMS. It's based around the idea of NMS adapters, where you can adapt the code you're running to the version the server is running. I decided to try and make a library out of that, and I'm still working on it. It's quite a large project, but I hope I can finish it in the near future.</li>
  <li><b>Komponent</b> - Komponent is an easy to use, fast and lightweight Minecraft chat component library written in Kotlin. It has native kotlinx.serialization support, and it's designed for easy conversion to and from JSON, without actually having to write raw JSON yourself. It also has a really nice DSL.</li>
</ul>

More projects may be coming soon, so keep your eyes peeled.
