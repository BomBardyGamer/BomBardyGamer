### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ hello! Good to see you!

My name's Callum, and I'm a 16 year old somewhat self-taught Kotlin/Java developer!

There's no point in me waffling on for hours and hours (which I have a tendency to do quite often), so I'm just gonna give you some things to look at.

<p>
  <h2 align="center">Here's some stuff I've been working on relatively recently:</h2>
</p>

<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>BardyBot</b> - BardyBot is a music bot that acts and responds like a human, but he's written in Spring, so he's super fast and reliable. I am unsure of how widely-used this is, as most just self-host it (and I don't track those statistics), but I can estimate it's ~10-15, which for me is an achievement.</li>
  <li><b>Punishments</b> - Technically, Punishments isn't just my project any more, it's on my organisation (when I say "my organisation", I mean an organisation that I have full ownership of) Prevarinite's GitHub page. It's mostly a W.I.P at this current stage, and will soon be ready for release, though I am getting quite busy with school and other projects, so that one might take a little longer</li>
  <li><b>Octo</b> - Octo is currently only a JDA command framework, built for BardyBot upon the main issue with the old framework I was using, [Matt's Framework for JDA](https://github.com/ipsk/MattFrameworkJDA), being annotation-based, making abstraction near-on impossible. I plan to rewrite Octo to make it a full dependency injection framework with loads of add-ons and other cool features, though that is long off</li>
</ul>
