### Hey there! I see you've come to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Callum, and I'm a 16 year old somewhat self-taught Kotlin/Java developer! I don't have that many personal projects because I spend most of my time making contributions to other open-source projects, as can be seen by my GitHub stats, but I do make a few personal projects, and I've listed them below.

Most of my time these days is spent working on <a href="https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton">Krypton</a>, which includes working on porting plugins over to my platform, such as <a href="https://github.com/BomBardyGamer/LuckPerms">LuckPerms</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BomBardyGamer/spark">spark</a>.
